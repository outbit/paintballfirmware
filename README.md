=================

Paintball Firmware for PIC16f648a microcontrollers. Engineered to work with the Dye Matrix Paintball Gun.

Use [MPLABX](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-x-ide) to open project files.

Requires the [MPLAB XC8 PRO](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-xc-compilers) compiler.
The free version of the MPLAB XC8 compiler does not provide enough optimizations for the code to fit on the PIC16f648a flash, unfortunately the PRO version is required (MPLAB offers a 60 day trial).
